      <h2>About the design</h2>
      <h3>The seven-pointed star</h3>
      <p>The seven points of the star are for the main seven hills of the city. The city is also 7 x 7 miles wide and tall, and 7 x 7 is equal to 49, referencing 1849, the year most commonly associated with the California gold rush.</p>
      <h3>The white and orange bars</h3>
      <p>The white and orange bars represent the two bridges of SF: the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge. The golden star represents both a gold nugget as well as the phoenix rising from the red ashes of the great fires of San Francisco.</p>
      <h3>Additional symbolism</h3>
      <p>Lastly, the star represents the setting sun of the West coast, against the white of the rolling fog that the city is known for.</p>

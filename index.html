    <h1>A new flag for San Francisco</h1>
    <img src="./flag.png" />
    <p>The white and orange bars represent the two bridges of SF: the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge. The golden star represents both a gold nugget as well as the phoenix rising from the red ashes of the great fires of San Francisco.</p>
    <p>The seven points of the star are for the main seven hills of the city. The city is also 7 x 7 miles wide and tall, and 7 x 7 is equal to 49, referencing 1849, the year most commonly associated with the California gold rush.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the star represents the setting sun of the West coast, against the white of the rolling fog that the city is known for.</p>
